```markdown
## 🔗 Related Topics

**Prerequisites**:

**Enables**:
- [Link to downstream applications]

**Cross-References**:
- [Link to related domains]
```

## Integration Requirements

When creating content, always:

1. **Identify Prerequisites**: What must learners know first?
2. **Link to Foundations**: What does this build upon?
3. **Show Applications**: What does this enable?
4. **Cross-Reference**: Connect to related GitHub Foundations exam domains (01_github-basics, 02_working-with-repositories, 03_collaboration, 04_github-tools, 05_security-and-best-practices, 06_open-source-and-community)
5. **Stage Mapping**: Which learning stages use this content?
