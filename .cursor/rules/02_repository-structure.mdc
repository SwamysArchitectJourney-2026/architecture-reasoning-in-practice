## 🧭 Repository Context

**Architecture Reasoning in Practice** is a personal learning repository documenting hands-on practice in architectural reasoning across senior and staff-level technical roles. It provides:

- Structured thinking approaches
- Trade-off analysis frameworks
- Clear communication of architectural decisions
- Practice with ambiguous and open-ended scenarios

**Target Audience**:

- Swamy (personal learning journey)
- Senior Software Engineers
- Principal Software Engineers
- Staff Engineers
- Software Architects
- Solution Architects
- AI Architects
- Engineering Managers
- Principal Consultants

**Purpose**: Develops real-world architectural judgment and decision-making capability through structured practice and analysis.

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Repository Purpose

**This repository (`architecture-reasoning-in-practice`) contains:**

- ✅ **Practice Content**: Architectural reasoning scenarios and exercises
- ✅ **Resources**: Frameworks, tools, and reference materials (`src/resources/`)
- ✅ **Templates**: Standard templates for consistent content (`docs/templates/`)

### 📋 Content Type Classifications

**Practice Content** (`src/01_reasoning-foundations/`, `src/02_answer-structuring/`, `src/03_tradeoff-articulation/`, `src/04_role-perspectives/`, `src/05_evaluation-scenarios/`):

- Purpose: Educational learning materials for architectural reasoning
- Structure: Each thinking mode has topic-specific markdown files
- File Naming: Descriptive names (e.g., `problem-framing.md`, `top-down-communication.md`)

**Resources** (`src/resources/`):

- Purpose: Frameworks, tools, and reference materials
- File Naming: Logical names (`frameworks.md`, `reference-materials.md`, `tools.md`)
