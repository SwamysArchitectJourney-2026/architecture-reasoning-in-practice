## Common Questions - Quick Reference

### System Design
**Q: "Design a scalable system for X"**
- Apply problem framing
- Identify constraints (scale, latency, consistency)
- Propose architecture with trade-offs
- Consider quality attributes

### Trade-offs
**Q: "What are the trade-offs of microservices?"**
- Pros: Independent deployment, technology diversity, team autonomy
- Cons: Operational complexity, distributed system challenges, network latency
- When to use: Multiple teams, different scaling needs, technology diversity

### Communication
**Q: "How do you explain technical decisions to stakeholders?"**
- Start with business impact
- Use analogies
- Focus on outcomes, not implementation
- Mention trade-offs in business terms

### Conflicting Requirements
**Q: "How do you handle conflicting requirements?"**
- Identify stakeholders
- Prioritize quality attributes
- Propose solutions with trade-offs
- Communicate reasoning

## Red Flags to Avoid

❌ Jumping to solutions without understanding the problem  
❌ Ignoring trade-offs  
❌ Focusing only on technical details  
❌ Pretending to know everything  
❌ Rambling without structure  
❌ Not asking clarifying questions  
❌ Ignoring non-functional requirements  

---

## Success Signals

✅ Clear problem framing  
✅ Structured thinking  
✅ Trade-off awareness  
✅ Long-term thinking  
✅ Effective communication  
✅ Quality attribute consideration  
✅ Honest about uncertainty

**Remember**: The goal is to demonstrate architectural thinking, not to have perfect answers. Show your reasoning process, not just solutions.
