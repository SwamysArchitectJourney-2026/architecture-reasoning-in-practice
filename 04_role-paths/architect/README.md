# Architect Role Path

**Scope**: System-wide design, long-term strategy, quality attributes, cross-team alignment

**Stop Conditions**: You can explain architectural decisions with trade-offs, handle ambiguous requirements, and communicate effectively with stakeholders.

## Role Definition

### What an Architect Does

An **Architect** focuses on:
- **System-wide design**: How components fit together across the entire system
- **Long-term strategy**: Decisions that affect the system for months to years
- **Quality attributes**: Performance, security, scalability, reliability, maintainability
- **Technology selection**: Choosing technologies and patterns that serve the system
- **Cross-team coordination**: Ensuring consistency and alignment across teams
- **Stakeholder communication**: Explaining technical decisions to non-technical audiences

### What an Architect Does NOT Do

- Write production code (may write prototypes)
- Manage people (may mentor)
- Make day-to-day implementation decisions (may guide)
- Own delivery timelines (may influence)

---

### Phase 3: Scenario Practice (Weeks 5-6)

**Practice architect scenarios**:

1. **System Design Scenarios** (`../../05_interview-practice/system-design/architect/`)
   - Design scalable systems
   - Explain complex architectures
   - Handle conflicting requirements

2. **Behavioral Scenarios** (`../../05_interview-practice/behavioral/`)
   - Leadership situations
   - Conflict resolution
   - Failure stories

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Practice 5+ system design scenarios
- [ ] Practice explaining architectures in 60 seconds
- [ ] Prepare STAR stories for behavioral questions
- [ ] Time yourself on scenarios

---

### Phase 4: Interview Preparation (Weeks 7-8)

**Final preparation**:

1. **Mock Interviews** (`../../05_interview-practice/mock-interviews/architect/`)
   - Full interview simulations
   - Feedback and improvement
   - Common question patterns

2. **Interview Checklist** (`interview-checklist.md`)
   - Final review checklist
   - Common questions

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Explain Architecture in 60 Seconds
- Pick a complex system you've worked on
- Explain it using top-down communication
- Mention key trade-offs
- Stop when you've answered

### Exercise 2: Design from Scratch
- Given a problem statement
- Apply problem framing
- Identify constraints
- Propose architecture with trade-offs

### Exercise 3: Handle Conflicting Requirements
- Identify stakeholders
- Prioritize quality attributes
- Propose solutions with trade-offs
- Explain your reasoning

---

## Interview Tips

### Do's
- **Start high-level** - Don't dive into details immediately
- **Always mention trade-offs** - Every decision has trade-offs
- **Think long-term** - Architects focus on system health over time
- **Consider quality attributes** - Performance, security, scalability, etc.
- **Admit uncertainty** - Shows maturity and honesty
- **Ask clarifying questions** - Shows structured thinking

### Don'ts
- Don't jump to solutions without understanding the problem
- Don't ignore trade-offs
- Don't focus only on technical details
- Don't pretend to know everything
- Don't ramble - control depth

## Common Interview Questions

### System Design
- "Design a scalable system for X"
- "How would you modernize a legacy system?"
- "Explain your architecture decisions"
- "How do you handle conflicting requirements?"

### Trade-offs
- "What are the trade-offs of microservices?"
