## 🔒 Structure Status

The repository structure is **locked and frozen**.

```
src/
├── 01_orientation/          ✅ LOCKED
├── 02_thinking/             ✅ LOCKED
├── 03_communication/        ✅ LOCKED
├── 04_roles/                ✅ LOCKED
├── 05_evaluation/           ✅ LOCKED
├── 06_reference/            ✅ LOCKED
└── 07_notes/                ✅ LOCKED
```

**No folder changes. Only content changes.**

---

## 📋 Contracts Defined

Each folder has a **contract** that defines:
- Purpose
- Allowed content
- Rules and restrictions
- Validation tests

**See**: `src/FOLDER_CONTRACTS.md`

**Rule**: If content violates a folder's contract, it goes to `07_notes/` or gets deleted.

---

## 🔄 Review Schedule

**Structure review**: Every 30-60 days (not daily)

**What to review:**
- Contract violations
- Content drift
- Unclear files in `07_notes/`

**What NOT to review:**
- Folder structure (it's locked)
- Folder purposes (they're contracted)

---

## ✅ Validation Complete

The structure is:
- ✅ **Architecturally sound** - Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ **Progressive** - Capability-driven learning path
- ✅ **Role-explicit** - Clear role boundaries
- ✅ **Professionally framed** - Readiness-based
- ✅ **Contract-enforced** - Folder purposes locked
- ✅ **Cross-repo linked** - Clear relationship with `system-design-in-practice`

---

## 🎯 Next Actions

1. **Add content** - Respect folder contracts
2. **Review monthly** - Check for contract violations
3. **Promote from `07_notes/`** - Move or delete unclear content
4. **Freeze for 60 days** - Let structure stabilize

---

**The architecture of the learning system is sound. Structure is locked.**
