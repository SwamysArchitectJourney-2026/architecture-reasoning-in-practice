# Decision Rationale Framing

## Summary

A structured approach to explaining architectural decisions that demonstrates reasoning, trade-off awareness, and long-term thinking.

## When to Use

Use when:
- Explaining why architectural patterns were chosen
- Justifying technology selections
- Defending design decisions
- Demonstrating reasoning capability

## How to Apply

**Decision Rationale Structure:**

1. **Context**
   - What problem were you solving?
   - What constraints existed?
   - What were the requirements?

2. **Decision**
   - What did you choose?
   - Why this specific approach?
   - What alternatives did you consider?

3. **Trade-offs**
   - What benefits did you gain?
   - What costs did you accept?
   - What did you give up?

4. **Consequences**
   - What were the outcomes?
   - What would you do differently?
   - What did you learn?

**Key Principle:**
> Every architectural decision should be explainable through: Context → Decision → Trade-offs → Consequences

**Common Patterns:**

**Pattern Selection:**
> "We chose [pattern] because [problem it solves]. The trade-off was [cost/benefit]. In hindsight, [what we learned]."

**Technology Selection:**
> "We selected [technology] for [specific reason]. We considered [alternatives] but chose this because [rationale]. The trade-off was [cost/benefit]."

**Avoid:**
- Listing features without explaining decisions
- Failing to acknowledge trade-offs
- Not considering alternatives
- Defensive or evasive answers

## Examples

**Strong Rationale:**
- Clear problem statement
- Explicit trade-off acknowledgment
- Alternative consideration
- Learning and reflection

**Weak Rationale:**
- Tool or pattern listing without context
- No trade-off discussion
- Defensive or evasive
- No learning or reflection
