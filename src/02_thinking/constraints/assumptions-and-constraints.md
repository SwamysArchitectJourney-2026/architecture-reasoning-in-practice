# Assumptions and Constraints

## Summary

Make hidden assumptions explicit and treat constraints as first-class inputs.

## When to Use

Use when decisions depend on scale, reliability, cost, or operating model.

## How to Apply

- List assumptions with validation paths.
- Classify constraints: business, technical, operational.
- Quantify where possible (traffic, latency, data size).
- Record what would change your decision.
