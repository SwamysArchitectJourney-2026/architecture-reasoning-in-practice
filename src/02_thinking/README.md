# Thinking Toolkit

**Purpose**: Role-agnostic frameworks for architectural reasoning and decision-making.

---

## Structure

- **`system-thinking/`** - Problem framing, clarification, decision rationale
- **`tradeoffs/`** - Trade-off analysis frameworks
- **`constraints/`** - Assumptions and constraints modeling
- **`failure-resilience/`** - Risk and failure thinking

---

## How to Use

These frameworks apply to **all roles**. Study these before role-specific content.

1. Start with `system-thinking/problem-framing.md`
2. Study `tradeoffs/` for decision-making
3. Review `constraints/` for constraint modeling
4. Understand `failure-resilience/` for risk thinking

---

## Key Principles

- **Role-agnostic**: These skills apply to all senior roles
- **Progressive**: Build from problem framing to trade-offs to risk
- **Practical**: Focus on "how to think" not "what to know"
