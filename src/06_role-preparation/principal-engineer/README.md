# Principal Software Engineer Role Preparation

## Role Focus

**Principal Software Engineers** focus on:
- Hands-on architecture and system design
- End-to-end technical leadership
- Mentoring and code quality
- Practical delivery with technical excellence

## Preparation Path

### Step 1: Master the Foundations (Required for All)

Study these first - they apply to all roles:

1. **Problem Framing** (`../../01_reasoning-foundations/problem-framing.md`)
2. **Top-Down Communication** (`../../02_answer-structuring/top-down-communication.md`)
3. **Trade-off Articulation** (`../../03_tradeoff-articulation/`)

### Step 2: Principal Engineer-Specific Scenarios

Practice these scenarios:

1. **Explaining Complex Architecture** (`../../05_evaluation-scenarios/explaining-complex-architecture.md`)
   - How to explain system design
   - Technical depth expected

2. **Microservices Transaction Management** (`../../05_evaluation-scenarios/microservices-transaction-management.md`)
   - Distributed systems challenges
   - Practical solutions

3. **Managing Complexity Trade-offs** (`../../05_evaluation-scenarios/managing-complexity-trade-offs.md`)
   - When to add complexity
   - Pragmatic decisions

4. **Vague Problem** (`../../05_evaluation-scenarios/vague-problem.md`)
   - How to handle ambiguous requirements
   - Ask clarifying questions

### Step 3: Principal Engineer-Specific Trade-offs

Understand these trade-offs:

1. **Cost vs Scale** (`../../03_tradeoff-articulation/cost-vs-scale.md`)
   - Scaling decisions
   - Cost optimization

2. **Simplicity vs Flexibility** (`../../03_tradeoff-articulation/simplicity-vs-flexibility.md`)
   - Pragmatic choices
   - When to keep it simple

3. **CQRS Selective Application** (`../../03_tradeoff-articulation/cqrs-selective-application.md`)
   - When CQRS is worth it
   - When it's overkill

4. **Polyglot Persistence Rationale** (`../../03_tradeoff-articulation/polyglot-persistence-rationale.md`)
   - Database selection
   - Practical considerations

5. **Risk and Failure Framing** (`../../03_tradeoff-articulation/risk-and-failure-framing.md`)
   - Identify risks
   - Mitigation strategies

### Step 4: Role Perspective

Read the principal engineer mindset:
- **Principal Engineer Perspective** (`../../04_role-perspectives/principal-engineer.md`)
  - Scope boundaries
  - Leverage and reuse
  - Long-term impact

### Step 5: Interview Materials

Review role-specific interview materials:
- `../../../source-material/PrincipalSoftwareEngineer_1.md`

## Key Topics to Master

### System Design
- End-to-end architecture
- Microservices design
- API design (REST, GraphQL)
- Event-driven architecture
- Database design and optimization

### Technical Leadership
- Code reviews and standards
- Design patterns
- Best practices
- Technical debt management
- Mentoring approach

### Hands-On Skills
- Backend engineering (Node.js, .NET, Python, Java)
- Cloud platforms (Azure, AWS, GCP)
- Database systems (SQL, NoSQL)
- Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)
- CI/CD and DevOps

### Problem Solving
- Complex technical problems
- Performance optimization
- Scalability challenges
- Security considerations

## Practice Exercises

1. **Design a system end-to-end**
   - From requirements to architecture
   - Database design
   - API design
   - Deployment considerations

2. **Code review scenario**
   - Identify issues
   - Suggest improvements
   - Explain trade-offs

3. **Mentoring scenario**
   - How to guide junior engineers
   - Technical leadership without authority

## Interview Tips

- **Be hands-on** - Show you can code and design
- **Explain trade-offs** - Every decision has trade-offs
- **Show mentoring** - How you help others grow
- **Be pragmatic** - Balance ideal vs practical
- **Demonstrate depth** - Deep expertise in key areas

## Common Questions

- "Design a scalable system for X"
- "How do you ensure code quality?"
- "How do you mentor engineers?"
- "What's your approach to technical debt?"
- "How do you make architecture decisions?"
