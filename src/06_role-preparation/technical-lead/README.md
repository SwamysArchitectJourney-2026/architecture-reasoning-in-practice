# Technical Lead Role Preparation

## Role Focus

**Technical Leads** focus on:
- Hands-on coding and architecture
- Team mentorship and technical guidance
- Delivery and execution
- Security and compliance
- Performance optimization

## Preparation Path

### Step 1: Master the Foundations (Required for All)

Study these first:

1. **Problem Framing** (`../../01_reasoning-foundations/problem-framing.md`)
2. **Top-Down Communication** (`../../02_answer-structuring/top-down-communication.md`)
3. **Trade-off Articulation** (`../../03_tradeoff-articulation/`)

### Step 2: Technical Lead-Specific Scenarios

Practice these scenarios:

1. **Explaining Complex Architecture** (`../../05_evaluation-scenarios/explaining-complex-architecture.md`)
   - Technical depth expected
   - Implementation details

2. **Vague Problem** (`../../05_evaluation-scenarios/vague-problem.md`)
   - Handle ambiguous requirements
   - Ask clarifying questions

3. **Managing Complexity Trade-offs** (`../../05_evaluation-scenarios/managing-complexity-trade-offs.md`)
   - Practical decisions
   - Delivery focus

### Step 3: Technical Lead-Specific Trade-offs

Understand these trade-offs:

1. **Simplicity vs Flexibility** (`../../03_tradeoff-articulation/simplicity-vs-flexibility.md`)
   - Pragmatic choices
   - Delivery speed

2. **Cost vs Scale** (`../../03_tradeoff-articulation/cost-vs-scale.md`)
   - Scaling decisions
   - Resource optimization

3. **Risk and Failure Framing** (`../../03_tradeoff-articulation/risk-and-failure-framing.md`)
   - Identify risks
   - Mitigation strategies

### Step 4: Interview Materials

Review role-specific interview materials:
- `../../../source-material/Technical_Lead_1.md`

## Key Topics to Master

### Technical Architecture
- Distributed systems
- Microservices
- Event-driven architecture
- Database design (MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
- API design (REST, GraphQL)

### Development Skills
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- Node.js/Nest.js
- Next.js/React
- Database optimization
- Performance tuning

### Security & Compliance
- Authentication and authorization
- Encryption (at rest, in transit)
- HIPAA compliance (if healthcare)
- Security best practices
- Audit logging

### DevOps & Deployment
- Docker and Kubernetes
- CI/CD pipelines
- Vercel/serverless
- Monitoring and observability

### Team Leadership
- Technical mentorship
- Code reviews
- Technical training
- Interviewing
- Culture building

## Practice Exercises

1. **Design and implement a feature**
   - Architecture
   - Database schema
   - API design
   - Security considerations

2. **Code review scenario**
   - Identify issues
   - Suggest improvements
   - Security concerns

3. **Mentoring scenario**
   - Guide junior developers
   - Technical training approach

## Interview Tips

- **Show hands-on skills** - You code and design
- **Demonstrate security awareness** - Critical for this role
- **Show delivery focus** - Balance quality and speed
- **Explain trade-offs** - Every decision has trade-offs
- **Show mentoring** - How you help team grow

## Common Questions

- "Design a secure API for X"
- "How do you optimize database queries?"
- "How do you mentor developers?"
- "How do you handle security in your architecture?"
- "What's your approach to technical debt?"
