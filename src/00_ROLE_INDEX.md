- `01_reasoning-foundations/assumptions-and-constraints.md` - Identify constraints

### Answer Structuring
- `02_answer-structuring/top-down-communication.md` - Start high-level
- `02_answer-structuring/depth-control.md` - Control how deep you go
- `02_answer-structuring/time-boxed-reasoning.md` - Work within time limits

### Trade-off Articulation
- `03_tradeoff-articulation/risk-and-failure-framing.md` - Frame risks
- `03_tradeoff-articulation/simplicity-vs-flexibility.md` - Common trade-off
