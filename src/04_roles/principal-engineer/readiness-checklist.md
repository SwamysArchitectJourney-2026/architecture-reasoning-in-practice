# Principal Engineer Readiness Checklist

This checklist validates readiness for
**Principal / Lead Software Engineer** responsibilities.

This role is about **technical execution at scale**.

---

## 1. Technical Depth

You can:

- ☐ Explain how systems behave under load
- ☐ Understand internal mechanics (runtime, network, storage)
- ☐ Reason about performance bottlenecks
- ☐ Make informed technology choices
- ☐ Debug beyond surface symptoms

Principal Engineers know how things work.

---

## 2. Design to Implementation

You can:

- ☐ Translate high-level designs into working systems
- ☐ Choose appropriate abstractions
- ☐ Manage complexity in codebases
- ☐ Prevent over-engineering
- ☐ Maintain long-term code health

Design must survive implementation.

---

## 3. Scalability & Performance

You can:

- ☐ Identify scaling limits
- ☐ Optimize throughput and latency
- ☐ Balance cost vs performance
- ☐ Design caching strategies
- ☐ Measure before optimizing

Performance is an engineering responsibility.

---

## 4. Production Debugging

You can:

- ☐ Diagnose distributed system failures
- ☐ Use logs, metrics, and traces effectively
- ☐ Perform root cause analysis
- ☐ Lead incident resolution
- ☐ Prevent recurrence

Production reveals the truth.

---

## 5. API & Data Design

You can:

- ☐ Design stable APIs
- ☐ Manage backward compatibility
- ☐ Choose appropriate data models
- ☐ Handle data consistency issues
- ☐ Avoid leaky abstractions

Interfaces define system quality.

---

## 6. Technical Leadership

You can:

- ☐ Mentor senior engineers
- ☐ Review designs critically
- ☐ Raise engineering standards
- ☐ Influence architecture constructively
- ☐ Lead without formal authority

Leadership is earned through competence.

---

## Stop Condition

You are principal-ready when you can:
- Own complex systems end-to-end
- Resolve high-impact production issues
- Influence architecture through facts
- Be the technical escalation point

If not, deepen execution skills.
