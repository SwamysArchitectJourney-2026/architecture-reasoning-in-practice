# Architect Role Path

**Scope**: System-wide design, long-term strategy, quality attributes, cross-team alignment

**Stop Conditions**: You can explain architectural decisions with trade-offs, handle ambiguous requirements, and communicate effectively with stakeholders.

---

## Role Definition

### What an Architect Does

An **Architect** focuses on:
- **System-wide design**: How components fit together across the entire system
- **Long-term strategy**: Decisions that affect the system for months to years
- **Quality attributes**: Performance, security, scalability, reliability, maintainability
- **Technology selection**: Choosing technologies and patterns that serve the system
- **Cross-team coordination**: Ensuring consistency and alignment across teams
- **Stakeholder communication**: Explaining technical decisions to non-technical audiences

### What an Architect Does NOT Do

- Write production code (may write prototypes)
- Manage people (may mentor)
- Make day-to-day implementation decisions (may guide)
- Own delivery timelines (may influence)

## What Architects Own

### Accountability Areas

**1. System Boundaries & Ownership**
- Define what's inside vs outside the system
- Establish clear ownership across teams
- Prevent accidental coupling
- Reason about upstream/downstream dependencies

**2. Architectural Decisions**
- Make decisions that affect multiple teams
- Justify technology and pattern choices
- Document trade-offs and rationale
- Ensure decisions align with long-term strategy

**3. Quality Attributes**
- Balance competing quality attributes
- Make NFRs influence design, not be afterthoughts
- Reason about scalability, reliability, security at system level
- Consider cost and operational impact

**4. Cross-Team Alignment**
- Ensure consistency across teams
- Establish technical standards pragmatically
- Guide teams without blocking them
- Align architecture with business goals

**5. Evolution & Modernization**
- Design for change over time
- Propose incremental modernization strategies
- Balance risk vs progress
- Avoid "big bang" rewrites

## Preparation Path

### Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-2)

**Study these first** (role-agnostic, apply to all roles):

1. **Thinking Toolkit** (`../../02_thinking/`)
   - System thinking
   - Trade-off analysis
   - Constraints modeling
   - Failure resilience

2. **Communication Frameworks** (`../../03_communication/`)
   - Structured answers
   - Whiteboard flow
   - Decision narratives

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Read all thinking toolkit modules
- [ ] Practice problem framing on 3 scenarios
- [ ] Practice top-down communication
- [ ] Understand trade-off analysis framework

---

### Phase 2: Architect-Specific Scope (Weeks 3-4)

**Understand architect accountability**:

1. **System Boundaries** - How to define and defend boundaries
2. **Long-Term Thinking** - Decisions that span months/years
3. **Cross-Team Coordination** - Ensuring consistency without blocking
4. **Stakeholder Communication** - Explaining technical decisions to non-technical audiences

**Study these areas**:
- Review `readiness-checklist.md` - Understand what you're accountable for
- Study system design patterns in `../../06_reference/architecture-patterns/`
- Understand trade-offs in `../../02_thinking/tradeoffs/`
- Practice communication in `../../03_communication/`

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Understand architect accountability areas
- [ ] Review readiness checklist
- [ ] Study relevant patterns and trade-offs
- [ ] Practice architect-specific communication

---

### Phase 3: Scenario Practice (Weeks 5-6)

**Practice architect scenarios**:

1. **System Design Scenarios** (`../../05_evaluation/system-design/architect/`)
   - Design scalable systems
   - Explain complex architectures
   - Handle conflicting requirements

2. **Leadership Scenarios** (`../../05_evaluation/leadership-scenarios/`)
   - Leadership situations
   - Conflict resolution
   - Failure stories

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Practice 5+ system design scenarios
- [ ] Practice explaining architectures in 60 seconds
- [ ] Prepare STAR stories for behavioral questions
- [ ] Time yourself on scenarios

---

### Phase 4: Final Preparation (Weeks 7-8)

**Final preparation**:

1. **Scenario Walkthroughs** (`../../05_evaluation/scenario-walkthroughs/architect/`)
   - Full evaluation simulations
   - Feedback and improvement

2. **Readiness Checklist** (`readiness-checklist.md`)
   - Final review checklist
   - Validate readiness

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Complete 3+ mock evaluations
- [ ] Review readiness checklist
- [ ] Validate all accountability areas

---

## Success Criteria

You're ready when you can:

1. ✅ Explain complex architectures clearly and concisely
2. ✅ Articulate trade-offs for every decision
3. ✅ Handle ambiguous requirements with structured thinking
4. ✅ Communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical audiences
5. ✅ Make long-term decisions considering system-wide impact
6. ✅ Balance competing requirements and quality attributes

---

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Study foundations
2. **Follow the checklist** - Track your progress
3. **Practice regularly** - Work through scenarios
4. **Review readiness checklist** - Before your evaluation
