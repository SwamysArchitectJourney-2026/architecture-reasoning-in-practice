# Architect Readiness Checklist

This checklist determines whether you are ready to operate as a
**Software / Solution Architect** in real systems, reviews, and evaluations.

If you cannot confidently check an item, return to:
- `02_thinking`
- `03_communication`
- `04_roles/architect`

Do not proceed forward prematurely.

---

## 1. Problem Framing & Context Setting

You can:

- ☐ Restate ambiguous problems in clear system terms
- ☐ Ask clarifying questions before proposing solutions
- ☐ Separate functional vs non-functional requirements early
- ☐ Identify business, regulatory, and organizational constraints
- ☐ Avoid premature technology decisions

Architects frame the problem **before** solving it.

---

## 2. System Boundaries & Ownership

You can:

- ☐ Define clear system boundaries
- ☐ Explain why a boundary exists
- ☐ Identify upstream/downstream dependencies
- ☐ Reason about ownership across teams
- ☐ Prevent accidental coupling

If boundaries are fuzzy, the architecture is weak.

---

## 3. High-Level Architecture

You can:

- ☐ Propose a coherent high-level design within 10–15 minutes
- ☐ Identify major components and responsibilities
- ☐ Explain data flow without implementation detail
- ☐ Justify architectural style choices
- ☐ Keep diagrams intentionally abstract

Architects design **structures**, not classes.

---

## 4. Trade-offs & Alternatives (Critical)

You can:

- ☐ Present at least two viable design options
- ☐ Explain why one option was chosen
- ☐ Explicitly discuss trade-offs (cost, latency, operability)
- ☐ Reject popular patterns with reasoning
- ☐ Say "it depends" and explain on what

Judgment matters more than correctness.

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

You can reason about:

- ☐ Scalability and growth patterns
- ☐ Reliability and availability
- ☐ Consistency trade-offs
- ☐ Security at architectural level
- ☐ Cost and operational impact

NFRs must influence design, not be an afterthought.

---

## 6. Failure & Resilience Thinking

You can:

- ☐ Identify single points of failure
- ☐ Design for partial failures
- ☐ Explain degradation strategies
- ☐ Discuss recovery and resilience
- ☐ Accept failure as normal

Architects assume systems will fail.

---

## 7. Evolution & Modernization

You can:

- ☐ Design for change over time
- ☐ Reason about legacy constraints
- ☐ Propose incremental modernization
- ☐ Balance risk vs progress
- ☐ Avoid "big bang" rewrites

Good architecture evolves safely.

---

## 8. Governance & Communication

You can:

- ☐ Explain designs to engineers and non-engineers
- ☐ Defend decisions under challenge
- ☐ Guide teams without blocking them
- ☐ Establish standards pragmatically
- ☐ Align architecture with business goals

Architecture is influence, not authority.

---

## Stop Condition

You are architect-ready when you can:
- Defend your design calmly
- Explain trade-offs clearly
- Accept critique without defensiveness
- Make decisions under uncertainty

If not, return to fundamentals.
