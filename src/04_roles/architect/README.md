# Architect Role Path

**Scope**: System-wide design, long-term strategy, quality attributes, cross-team alignment

**Stop Conditions**: You can explain architectural decisions with trade-offs, handle ambiguous requirements, and communicate effectively with stakeholders.

---

## Role Definition

### What an Architect Does

An **Architect** focuses on:
- **System-wide design**: How components fit together across the entire system
- **Long-term strategy**: Decisions that affect the system for months to years
- **Quality attributes**: Performance, security, scalability, reliability, maintainability
- **Technology selection**: Choosing technologies and patterns that serve the system
- **Cross-team coordination**: Ensuring consistency and alignment across teams
- **Stakeholder communication**: Explaining technical decisions to non-technical audiences

### What an Architect Does NOT Do

- Write production code (may write prototypes)
- Manage people (may mentor)
- Make day-to-day implementation decisions (may guide)
- Own delivery timelines (may influence)

## Preparation Path

### Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-2)

**Study these first** (role-agnostic, apply to all roles):

1. **Thinking Toolkit** (`../../02_thinking/`)
   - System thinking
   - Trade-off analysis
   - Constraints modeling
   - Failure resilience

2. **Communication Frameworks** (`../../03_communication/`)
   - Structured answers
   - Whiteboard flow
   - Decision narratives

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Read all thinking toolkit modules
- [ ] Practice problem framing on 3 scenarios
- [ ] Practice top-down communication
- [ ] Understand trade-off analysis framework

---

### Phase 2: Architect-Specific Knowledge (Weeks 3-4)

**Study architect-specific content**:

1. **System Design** - Architecture patterns, microservices, DDD, event-driven architecture
2. **Trade-offs at Scale** - Cost vs scale, simplicity vs flexibility, consistency vs availability
3. **Migrations & Modernization** - Legacy system modernization, migration strategies, risk management
4. **Governance & Communication** - Cross-team coordination, stakeholder communication, technical standards

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Study all system design patterns
- [ ] Understand trade-offs deeply
- [ ] Practice migration scenarios
- [ ] Review governance approaches

---

### Phase 3: Scenario Practice (Weeks 5-6)

**Practice architect scenarios**:

1. **System Design Scenarios** (`../../05_evaluation/system-design/architect/`)
   - Design scalable systems
   - Explain complex architectures
   - Handle conflicting requirements

2. **Leadership Scenarios** (`../../05_evaluation/leadership-scenarios/`)
   - Leadership situations
   - Conflict resolution
   - Failure stories

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Practice 5+ system design scenarios
- [ ] Practice explaining architectures in 60 seconds
- [ ] Prepare STAR stories for behavioral questions
- [ ] Time yourself on scenarios

---

### Phase 4: Final Preparation (Weeks 7-8)

**Final preparation**:

1. **Scenario Walkthroughs** (`../../05_evaluation/scenario-walkthroughs/architect/`)
   - Full evaluation simulations
   - Feedback and improvement
   - Common question patterns

2. **Readiness Checklist** (`readiness-checklist.md`)
   - Final review checklist
   - Common questions
   - Answer frameworks

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Complete 3+ mock evaluations
- [ ] Review readiness checklist
- [ ] Practice common questions
- [ ] Prepare questions to ask evaluators

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Explain Architecture in 60 Seconds
- Pick a complex system you've worked on
- Explain it using top-down communication
- Mention key trade-offs
- Stop when you've answered

### Exercise 2: Design from Scratch
- Given a problem statement
- Apply problem framing
- Identify constraints
- Propose architecture with trade-offs

### Exercise 3: Handle Conflicting Requirements
- Identify stakeholders
- Prioritize quality attributes
- Propose solutions with trade-offs
- Explain your reasoning

---

## Evaluation Tips

### Do's
- **Start high-level** - Don't dive into details immediately
- **Always mention trade-offs** - Every decision has trade-offs
- **Think long-term** - Architects focus on system health over time
- **Consider quality attributes** - Performance, security, scalability, etc.
- **Admit uncertainty** - Shows maturity and honesty
- **Ask clarifying questions** - Shows structured thinking

### Don'ts
- Don't jump to solutions without understanding the problem
- Don't ignore trade-offs
- Don't focus only on technical details
- Don't pretend to know everything
- Don't ramble - control depth

---

## Common Evaluation Questions

### System Design
- "Design a scalable system for X"
- "How would you modernize a legacy system?"
- "Explain your architecture decisions"
- "How do you handle conflicting requirements?"

### Trade-offs
- "What are the trade-offs of microservices?"
- "How do you choose between SQL and NoSQL?"
- "When is CQRS appropriate?"
- "What are the trade-offs of managed services?"

### Communication
- "How do you explain technical decisions to non-technical stakeholders?"
- "How do you handle disagreements about architecture?"
- "How do you ensure consistency across teams?"
