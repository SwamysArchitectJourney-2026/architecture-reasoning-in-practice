# Principal Engineer Role Path

**Scope**: Hands-on architecture, technical depth, mentoring, code quality, practical implementation

**Stop Conditions**: You can design end-to-end systems, write high-quality code, mentor engineers effectively, and make technical decisions with clear trade-offs.

---

## Role Definition

### What a Principal Engineer Does

A **Principal Engineer** focuses on:
- **Hands-on architecture**: Designing and implementing systems end-to-end
- **Technical depth**: Deep expertise in multiple areas (backend, cloud, databases, etc.)
- **Code quality**: Writing, reviewing, and maintaining high-quality code
- **Technical mentorship**: Guiding and growing other engineers
- **Technical standards**: Defining coding standards, design patterns, and best practices
- **Practical implementation**: Making architecture decisions that work in practice

### What a Principal Engineer Does NOT Do

- Manage people (may mentor, but not people management)
- Make only high-level decisions (hands-on involvement expected)
- Ignore code quality (code reviews and standards are core)
- Work in isolation (collaboration and mentoring are essential)
