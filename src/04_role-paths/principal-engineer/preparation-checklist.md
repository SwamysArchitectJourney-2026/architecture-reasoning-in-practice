## Red Flags to Avoid

❌ Ignoring implementation details  
❌ Skipping code quality considerations  
❌ Avoiding hands-on questions  
❌ Pretending to know everything  
❌ Ignoring mentoring aspects  
❌ Not showing technical depth  
❌ Ignoring trade-offs  

---

## Success Signals

✅ Clear problem framing  
✅ Hands-on technical skills  
✅ Trade-off awareness  
✅ Code quality focus  
✅ Effective mentoring  
✅ Practical implementation  
✅ Honest about uncertainty  

---

## Technical Focus Areas

### Backend Engineering
- Language expertise (Node.js, .NET, Python, Java)
- API design (REST, GraphQL)
- Microservices
- Event-driven architecture

### Cloud & Infrastructure
- Cloud platforms (Azure, AWS, GCP)
- Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)
- CI/CD pipelines
- Infrastructure as code

### Databases
- SQL databases (design, optimization)
- NoSQL databases (selection, modeling)
- Caching strategies
- Data modeling

### Performance & Scalability
- Performance optimization
- Caching
- Load balancing
- Monitoring and observability

---

**Remember**: The goal is to demonstrate hands-on technical leadership, not just theoretical knowledge. Show your ability to design, implement, and mentor.
