**This IS**:

- Structured thinking frameworks
- Role-specific preparation guides
- Evaluation practice materials

## 📋 Hard Rules

To keep this repository clean:

1. **No role folders outside `04_roles`**
2. **No evaluation content outside `05_evaluation`**
3. **If a file fits multiple roles → it belongs in `02_thinking`**
4. **Reference materials go in `06_reference`**

These rules prevent confusion and maintain structure.

**See `FOLDER_CONTRACTS.md` for detailed folder contracts and enforcement rules.**
