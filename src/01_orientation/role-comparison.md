## Core Distinctions

### Software Architect

**Primary Focus**: System-wide design, long-term strategy, quality attributes

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Define system architecture and patterns
- Make technology selection decisions
- Ensure cross-team consistency
- Balance non-functional requirements
- Communicate with stakeholders

**Decision Scope**: System-wide, long-term (months to years)

**Key Skills**:
- System-level thinking
- Quality attributes (performance, security, scalability)
- Technology selection
- Stakeholder communication
- Risk and trade-off analysis

**Typical Questions**:
- "How should we structure our system?"
- "What technologies should we adopt?"
- "How do we ensure consistency across teams?"

### Principal Software Engineer

**Primary Focus**: Hands-on architecture, technical depth, mentoring

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Design end-to-end systems
- Write and review code
- Mentor engineers
- Define coding standards
- Make technical decisions with delivery impact

**Decision Scope**: System-level, but hands-on (weeks to months)

**Key Skills**:
- Deep technical expertise
- System design
- Code quality
- Technical mentorship
- Practical implementation

**Typical Questions**:

- Cross-team collaboration
- Technical execution
- Quality assurance
- Mentorship

**Typical Questions**:
- "How do we deliver this project?"
- "How do we coordinate across teams?"
- "What's the implementation plan?"

---

### Engineering Manager

**Primary Focus**: People management + technical leadership

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Manage and mentor team
- Technical strategy
- Project planning
- Resource allocation
- Cross-functional collaboration

**Decision Scope**: Team and project level (weeks to quarters)

**Key Skills**:
- People management
- Technical leadership
- Project management
- Team building
- Stakeholder management

**Typical Questions**:

## Role Progression

### Typical Career Path

**Junior Engineer** → **Senior Engineer** → **Staff Engineer** → **Principal Engineer** → **Architect**

**Or**:

**Senior Engineer** → **Engineering Manager** → **Senior Engineering Manager**

### Key Transitions

**To Principal Engineer**:
- Add: System architecture, technical standards, deep expertise

**To Architect**:
- Add: System-wide thinking, long-term strategy, stakeholder management

**To Engineering Manager**:
- Add: People management, team building, resource planning

## Which Role Should You Prepare For?

### Choose **Architect** if:
- You want to focus on system-wide design
- You enjoy technology selection and standards
- You're comfortable with long-term thinking
- You want to work with stakeholders

### Choose **Principal Engineer** if:
- You want hands-on architecture work
- You enjoy coding and technical depth
- You want to mentor engineers
- You prefer practical implementation

### Choose **Staff Engineer** if:
- You want to lead project execution
- You enjoy cross-team collaboration
- You want technical leadership without management
- You focus on delivery

### Choose **Engineering Manager** if:
- You want to manage people
- You enjoy team building
- You want to combine technical and people leadership
- You're comfortable with project management

## Overlap and Collaboration

**Important**: These roles often work together:

- **Architect** defines the system design
- **Principal Engineer** implements the architecture
- **Staff Engineer** executes projects
- **Engineering Manager** manages the team

They're complementary, not hierarchical.
