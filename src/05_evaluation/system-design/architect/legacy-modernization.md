# Legacy Modernization

## Context

A legacy system is brittle, hard to change, and blocks delivery.

## Ambiguities

- Where is the true bottleneck: code, process, data, or ownership?
- What are the constraints (regulatory, uptime, deadlines)?
- What is the expected target state?

## Clarifying Questions

- What changes are most urgent and why?
- What parts are stable vs. volatile?
- Who owns operations and support today?

## Trade-offs Analysis

- Strangler approach vs. big rewrite.
- Incremental risk reduction vs. faster feature delivery.

## Structured Reasoning

Define success, slice the system by boundaries, modernize incrementally, and measure risk reduction.

## Reflections

Which early signals indicate the modernization plan is failing?
