# Architect

## Focus

Long-range trade-offs, consistency, and quality attributes across the system.

## Example heuristics

- Identify and prioritize quality attributes.
- Assess coupling and change boundaries.
- Choose standards where they reduce ambiguity and risk.
- Frame decisions in terms of long-term system health.
- Balance architectural purity with practical delivery needs.

## Practical Application

**When Evaluating Patterns:**
- Consider how patterns affect system-wide consistency
- Assess impact on future change boundaries
- Evaluate standards that reduce ambiguity across teams
- Prioritize quality attributes that matter most

**When Making Trade-offs:**
- Long-term maintainability vs short-term delivery speed
- Architectural consistency vs domain-specific optimization
- Standardization vs flexibility
- System-wide quality attributes vs local optimizations

**Key Distinction:**
Architects focus on how decisions affect the entire system over time, not just immediate delivery needs.
