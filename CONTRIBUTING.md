# Contributing to Architecture Reasoning in Practice

This is a **personal learning repository** documenting hands-on practice in architectural reasoning.

## Purpose

This repository is primarily for personal learning and documentation. If you're following a similar learning path, feel free to use this as a reference, but please note:

- This is **not an official repository**
- Content is based on personal study and practice
- The structure and content reflect one individual's learning approach

## Focus Areas

This repository focuses on:

- **Reasoning Foundations** - Problem framing, clarification strategies, assumptions and constraints
- **Answer Structuring** - Top-down communication, depth control, time-boxed reasoning
- **Trade-off Articulation** - Cost vs scale, simplicity vs flexibility, risk and failure framing
- **Role Perspectives** - How different roles think when solving the same ambiguous problem
- **Evaluation Scenarios** - Vague problems, conflicting requirements, legacy modernization

> **📋 Important Distinction**: This repository focuses on reasoning and articulation. Detailed system designs and implementations live in `system-design-in-practice`.

## Repository Structure

See [`docs/01_repository-structure.md`](docs/01_repository-structure.md) for the complete repository structure (single source of truth). See [README.md](README.md) for the learning path.

## Notes

- This is a personal learning repository
- Content is organized for practice and skill development
- Focus is on architectural reasoning, not specific technologies
