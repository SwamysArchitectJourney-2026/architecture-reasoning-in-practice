## Why This Session

Many GitHub users interact with repositories daily but lack a clear understanding of **GitHub as a product platform** — its account types, plans, billing model, and usage tracking.

This gap often leads to confusion such as:

* Confusing GitHub accounts with organizations
* Not understanding which features are plan-based vs usage-based
* Assuming GitHub billing works per repository instead of per organization
* Being unaware of how license and metered usage is tracked
* Underutilizing GitHub Desktop and GitHub Mobile

This session builds **platform literacy**, which is critical for:

* GitHub Foundations certification
* Team leads and administrators
* Anyone responsible for cost, governance, or access control
