## Why This Session

Version control is the foundation of modern software development. This session establishes the essential concepts and hands-on skills needed to work with Git and GitHub effectively.

Most challenges with Git and GitHub happen **before understanding the fundamentals**:

* Developers confuse Git (version control) with GitHub (hosting platform)
* Teams struggle with branching and merging workflows
* Beginners don't understand the difference between local and remote repositories
* Professionals miss the collaborative power of pull requests and code reviews

Without the right foundation, every workflow downstream becomes confusing. This session establishes the conceptual and practical foundation required for **all subsequent GitHub Foundations sessions**.
