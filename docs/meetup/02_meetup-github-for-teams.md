## Why This Session

Effective collaboration on GitHub requires understanding workflows, repository management, and team coordination. This session focuses on practical skills for working in teams and managing collaborative projects.

Common challenges teams face with GitHub collaboration:

* Teams don't understand the Issues → Branches → PRs → Merge workflow
* Repository settings are misconfigured, leading to security or workflow issues
* Team members struggle to navigate GitHub's UI and find essential features
* Collaboration breaks down due to unclear processes and communication gaps

This session provides the practical knowledge and hands-on experience needed to collaborate effectively on GitHub, whether you're working in a small team or contributing to open source projects.
