# Architecture Reasoning in Practice

**Purpose**: Develop architectural reasoning and decision-making skills for senior technical roles.

This repository focuses on **how to think**, not just what to know.

---

## 🎯 What This Is

**This IS:**
- A professional reasoning system for senior engineers
- Structured thinking frameworks
- Role-specific preparation guides
- Evaluation practice materials
- A place to build architectural judgment

**This is NOT:**
- A course or official curriculum
- A collection of system design solutions
- A replacement for hands-on experience
- An interview cheat sheet

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Architects
1. Read `src/01_orientation/README.md`
2. Study `src/02_thinking/` (foundations)
3. Review `src/04_roles/architect/README.md`
4. Practice with `src/05_evaluation/system-design/architect/`

### For Principal Engineers
1. Read `src/01_orientation/README.md`
2. Study `src/02_thinking/` (foundations)
3. Review `src/04_roles/principal-engineer/README.md`

## 📚 Folder Contracts

Each folder has a **contract** that defines its purpose and rules.

**Rule**: If content violates a folder's contract, it goes to `07_notes/` or gets deleted.

See `src/FOLDER_CONTRACTS.md` for detailed contracts.
