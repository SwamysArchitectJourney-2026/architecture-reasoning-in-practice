**Repository**: [architecture-reasoning-in-practice](https://github.com/Swamy-s-Tech-Skills-Academy-2026/architecture-reasoning-in-practice)

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is NOT a course or official curriculum. This is Swamy's personal learning journey and practice log.**

This repository documents hands-on practice in **architectural reasoning** across senior and staff-level technical roles. The focus is on **how senior people think, reason, and communicate** when facing ambiguous and open-ended problems.

The goal of this repo is to develop **architectural judgment and decision-making capability** through structured practice in reasoning, articulation, and evaluation.

> **📋 Important Distinction**: This repository focuses on reasoning and articulation. Detailed system designs and implementations live in `system-design-in-practice`.

## 📌 Disclaimer

This is **Swamy's personal learning** repository and practice log, not official course material or a packaged curriculum.

### Documentation Quality Checks (Local)

Run Markdown lint against README and all documentation before opening a PR:

```bash
# From repo root - lint all markdown files
npx --yes markdownlint-cli2 "README.md" "docs/**/*.md" ".github/**/*.md"
```

This uses the repository's `.markdownlint.json` configuration automatically.

### Link Validation (Lychee)

Run link checker to validate all links in documentation:

```bash
# Validate all links (recommended; matches CI behavior)
docker run --rm -w /input -v "${PWD}:/input" lycheeverse/lychee:latest --config lychee.toml --no-progress README.md docs/**/*.md .github/**/*.md
```

### Pre-Commit Checklist

Before committing changes:

- [ ] Run markdownlint and fix any issues
- [ ] Run Lychee link checker (if Docker available)
- [ ] Verify all file references point to existing files
- [ ] Check that code fences have language specifications
- [ ] Ensure proper blank lines around headings and lists
