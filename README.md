# Architecture Reasoning in Practice

This repository documents hands-on practice in architectural reasoning across senior and staff-level
technical roles. The focus is on structured thinking, trade-off analysis, and clear communication of
decisions in ambiguous and open-ended scenarios.

The material is applicable to roles such as:

- Senior Software Engineer
- Principal Software Engineer
- Staff Engineer
- Software Architect
- Solution Architect
- AI Architect
- Engineering Manager
- Principal Consultant

While commonly used for interview preparation, the primary goal is to develop
real-world architectural judgment and decision-making capability.

This is not a course. It is an evolving practice log.
